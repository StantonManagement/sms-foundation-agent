top_issues:
  - id: "MIG-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "No Alembic migration present for `sms_messages`; deployment drift risk."
    suggested_action: "Add initial Alembic migration creating table with UNIQUE index on `twilio_sid`."
  - id: "OBS-002"
    severity: low
    finding: "Duplicate and success share same event name; distinguish only via `duplicate` flag."
    suggested_action: "Optionally use distinct event names or add a `reason` field for easier log queries."
  - id: "PERF-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Service issues a pre-read prior to insert; extra round-trip under load."
    suggested_action: "Consider insert-first with unique-violation handling to reduce DB calls."
  - id: "API-002"
    severity: low
    finding: "Missing MessageSid results in 200 no-op; may mask malformed posts."
    suggested_action: "Document rationale (avoid Twilio retries) and monitor occurrence rate."

  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Create and apply Alembic migration for `sms_messages`"
    monitor:
      - "Logging queries for duplicate rate and missing-sid occurrences"
      - "DB round-trips if traffic becomes high"
