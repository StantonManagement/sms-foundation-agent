story_title: "Phone Normalization and Tenant Lookup"
gate: "PASS"  # PASS|CONCERNS|FAIL|WAIVED
status_reason: "AC1–6 met: phone normalization and ordered variants implemented; tenant lookup with retry/backoff integrated into inbound flow; tests cover success/no-match/transient failure. Webhook path resilient to monitor issues. Minor observability and latency improvement opportunities identified."

top_issues:
  - id: "LAT-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Synchronous tenant lookup (timeout ~3s, up to 4 attempts) could approach ~12s worst-case under monitor outages."
    suggested_action: "Consider reduced timeouts, circuit breaker, or deferring lookup to background while fast-acking the webhook."
  - id: "OBS-002"
    severity: low
    finding: "Retry attempt counts are not logged for tenant lookup outcomes."
    suggested_action: "Emit attempt count and latency metrics in logs or metrics to aid troubleshooting."
  - id: "INT-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "country_stripped fallback is US-leaning; non-US cases may degrade when phonenumbers parsing fails."
    suggested_action: "Ensure correct default region in config or prefer strict phonenumbers handling."
  - id: "TEST-002"
    severity: low
    finding: "Service-level test does not explicitly assert behavior when the client raises unexpectedly."
    suggested_action: "Add a test that forces a client exception and verifies the webhook path remains unaffected."
