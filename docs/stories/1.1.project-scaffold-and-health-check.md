# Story 1.1: Project Scaffold and Health Check

**Status:** Done

**Story**
**As a** platform operator,
**I want** a scaffolded FastAPI service with a health endpoint,
**so that** I can deploy and verify environment readiness quickly.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. GET `/health` returns 200 JSON including app version and an "ok" field
2. Health checks run lightweight dependency probes (config present; optional DB reachable flag without blocking)
3. Configuration loads from environment variables with sensible defaults for local dev
4. Dockerfile and (optional) docker-compose enable local run; README has quickstart

**Tasks / Subtasks**
- [x] Initialize Python project skeleton (AC: 1, 3)
  - [x] Create `src/` with baseline layout aligning to project structure [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#Source Directories]
  - [x] Add `pyproject.toml` with FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic, structlog and tooling from tech stack [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]
  - [x] Add `src/api/__init__.py`, `src/api/health.py`, `src/main.py`
  - [x] Add `src/utils/config.py` for env-config loading (pydantic BaseSettings) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Core Standards]
- [x] Implement health endpoint (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Define GET `/health` returning `{ ok: true, version: <app_version>, checks: { config: true, db: <bool or "unknown"> } }`
  - [x] Include lightweight probes: confirm config loads; DB flag is non-blocking and fast [Source: architecture/components.md#Observability & Health]
  - [x] Ensure structured logging of request with request_id [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Rules]
- [x] Configuration management (AC: 3)
  - [x] Implement `Settings` using environment variables with sensible local defaults (e.g., `APP_ENV=local`) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]
  - [x] Expose `APP_VERSION` via config or package metadata used in `/health`
- [x] Containerization and local run (AC: 4)
  - [x] Add multi-stage `Dockerfile` for FastAPI/Uvicorn [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Container]
  - [x] Add optional `docker-compose.yml` for local run (service + optional Postgres) [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#Top-level Layout]
  - [x] Write `README` Quickstart: local venv, uvicorn run, Docker build/run
- [x] Quality setup
  - [x] Add `ruff`, `black`, `isort`, `mypy` configs and pre-commit hooks [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Lint/Format/Type]
  - [x] Add basic unit tests for `/health` and config loader under `tests/unit` [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Test Organization]

**Dev Notes**
- Previous Story Insights: None (first story in Epic 1).
- Data Models: No specific persistence required in this story; DB probe is optional and must not block [Source: architecture/components.md#Observability & Health].
- API Specifications:
  - Endpoint: GET `/health` returns 200 JSON with `ok` and `version` fields; include optional sub-checks for config and DB reachability [Source: architecture/components.md#Observability & Health].
  - Use FastAPI for routing and Pydantic for response model types [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table].
- Component/Service Context: Health Router is part of API layer; probes consult config and optionally DB/session if available [Source: architecture/components.md#Observability & Health].
- File Locations (align with project structure):
  - `src/api/health.py` — FastAPI router for `/health`
  - `src/main.py` — app factory and router includes
  - `src/utils/config.py` — pydantic `BaseSettings` for environment config
  - `tests/unit/api/test_health.py` — unit tests for health endpoint
  - `tests/unit/utils/test_config.py` — unit tests for config loader
  [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#Source Directories]
- Logging & Observability: Use `structlog` JSON logs; include `request_id` in log context; never log secrets [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Rules].
- Technical Constraints:
  - Python 3.11; FastAPI + Uvicorn; Pydantic v2; tooling pinned as per stack [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table].
  - Keep webhook responses fast across the service; for health, probes must be lightweight [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#High Level Overview].
- Project Structure Notes: Follow suggested `src/`, `tests/` layout to keep components modular and testable [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#Source Directories].

### Testing
- Test file location: `tests/unit` for unit tests; future `tests/integration` for container/DB if needed [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Test Organization].
- Frameworks: `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio` as needed; FastAPI `TestClient` for sync-style tests of `/health` [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Testing].
- Standards: Type hints and Pydantic models; avoid network calls in unit tests; structure logs not asserted directly except presence of fields if captured [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Core Standards].
- Specific requirements for this story: assert `/health` returns 200 with `ok: true` and a non-empty `version` string; ensure config probe is true; DB probe may be `false` or `"unknown"` but must not fail the endpoint (AC 1–2).

**Status:** Ready for Review

**QA Results**
Gate Decision: PASS
Reason: All acceptance criteria (1–4) are met with clean, minimal implementation; unit tests, containerization, and quickstart docs are present. Low risk for this scope. Note: tests not executed here due to missing local deps, but coverage appears appropriate.

Requirements Traceability
- AC1 (/health 200 + ok + version): Implemented in `src/api/health.py` (returns `ok: true`, `version` from settings). Covered by `tests/unit/api/test_health.py`.
- AC2 (lightweight probes: config + optional DB flag): Implemented with `checks = {config: true, db: "unknown"}`; non-blocking. Covered by `tests/unit/api/test_health.py`.
- AC3 (env config with sensible defaults): Implemented in `src/utils/config.py` via `BaseSettings` with defaults and `.env` support. Covered by `tests/unit/utils/test_config.py`.
- AC4 (Docker + compose + README quickstart): `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `README.md` present with clear local run instructions.

Test Assessment
- Unit tests exist for health endpoint and config defaults/env overrides. Scope matches story. Suggestion (optional): add a small assertion that `request_id` appears in logs if log capture is configured later.

NFR Assessment (advisory)
- Performance: PASS — trivial handler, constant-time work.
- Reliability: PASS — deterministic response paths; no external calls.
- Observability: PASS — structured JSON logs with `request_id` included.
- Maintainability: PASS — clear layout (`src/`, `tests/`), typed code, tooling configured.
- Security: PASS (for scope) — no sensitive data exposure; consider future hardening when adding auth/features.

Risks & Recommendations
- Risk: Low overall. 
- Notes: (1) Story contains duplicate Status fields ("Approved" at top, "Ready for Review" later) — consider consolidating to a single Status. (2) Dependency versions pinned in Dockerfile separate from `pyproject.toml` may drift — consider aligning via installing from the project or using a lock to avoid divergence.

Evidence
- Files reviewed: `src/main.py`, `src/api/health.py`, `src/utils/config.py`, tests under `tests/unit`, Docker assets, README, tooling configs.
- Could not execute tests in this environment (pytest not installed), but test design and coverage look sufficient for the scope.
