# Story 1.3: Idempotency by MessageSid

**Status:** Done

**Story**
**As the** webhook processor,
**I want** idempotent handling keyed by Twilio `MessageSid`,
**so that** duplicate retries or replays do not create duplicate records.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. Duplicate inbound webhook with same `MessageSid` does not create another message row
2. Idempotency check is race-safe (unique index or transactional guard)
3. Logs indicate duplicate-skip path distinctly from success path
4. Test simulates duplicate post; database shows single message row

**Tasks / Subtasks**
- [x] Define minimal persistence for idempotency (AC: 1–2,4)
  - [x] Add `sms_messages` model with required fields for this story: `id`, `twilio_sid` (UNIQUE), `direction` (inbound), `created_at` [Source: architecture/data-models.md#sms_messages]
  - [x] Create Alembic migration (or initial schema script) adding `sms_messages` with a unique index on `twilio_sid` [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#Data Consistency]
  - [x] Implement repository method `get_by_sid(sid)` and `insert_inbound_minimal(...)` [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Repository Pattern]
- [x] Implement idempotent service logic (AC: 1–3)
  - [x] Create `SmsInboundService.handle_inbound(payload)` that extracts `MessageSid`, checks existence, and either no-ops (duplicate) or inserts a minimal row [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Idempotency]
  - [x] Ensure operation is race-safe using DB unique constraint with transactional insert; catch unique violations and treat as duplicate [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#Data Consistency]
  - [x] Log structured messages with `request_id` and `twilio_sid`, with distinct `duplicate=true/false` marker [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#Logging Standards]
- [x] Integrate with webhook handler from Story 1.2 (AC: 1–3)
  - [x] Update `POST /webhook/twilio/sms` to call `SmsInboundService.handle_inbound(...)` after signature verification [Source: architecture/components.md#WebhookRouter]
  - [x] Maintain fast 200 on both first and duplicate deliveries; body may be empty [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Background Work]
- [x] Unit tests: duplicate behavior (AC: 3–4)
  - [x] Add `tests/unit/services/test_inbound_idempotency.py` to validate service-level idempotency (first insert vs second duplicate)
  - [x] Add `tests/unit/api/test_twilio_webhook_idempotency.py` to post duplicate payloads through the API and assert single DB row
  - [x] Use an in-memory or ephemeral DB suitable for unit tests; verify unique constraint behavior; avoid network calls [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Test Organization]
- [x] Prepare for Story 1.4 expansion
  - [x] Leave placeholders/notes to extend `sms_messages` with additional fields (content, raw payload, conversation link) next story [Source: architecture/data-models.md#sms_messages]

**Dev Notes**
- Previous Story Insights: Story 1.2 added the Twilio webhook endpoint with signature verification and structured logging. Extend that router to invoke idempotent processing after signature verification and before any heavy work [Source: stories/1.2.twilio-sms-webhook-receiver.md].
- Data Models:
  - `sms_messages` table exists with at least `twilio_sid` unique index ensuring dedupe. Later stories add `raw_webhook_data`, conversation linkage, etc. [Source: architecture/data-models.md#sms_messages]
- API/Service Design:
  - Webhook Router delegates to `SmsInboundService` which uses a repository for DB access; no inline SQL in routers [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Repository Pattern].
  - Idempotency path: On duplicate, do not raise user-visible error; return 200 OK and log a `duplicate=true` event [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Idempotency].
- Error Handling & Logging:
  - Catch DB unique violations and translate to a duplicate no-op path; never leak stack traces [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#General Approach].
  - Logs include JSON fields: `request_id`, `twilio_sid`, `route=/webhook/twilio/sms`, and `duplicate` flag [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#Logging Standards].
- Performance:
  - Keep handler quick; any enrichment or tenant lookup deferred to later stories (background tasks) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Background Work].
- File Locations (align with structure):
  - `src/api/webhooks/twilio.py` — call into service after signature verification
  - `src/services/sms_inbound.py` — `SmsInboundService`
  - `src/repositories/messages.py` — `MessageRepository` with `get_by_sid`/`insert`
  - `src/db/models.py` — SQLAlchemy models, incl. `SmsMessage`
  - `tests/unit/services/test_inbound_idempotency.py` — service tests
  - `tests/unit/api/test_twilio_webhook_idempotency.py` — API duplicate tests
  [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#Source Directories]
- Technical Constraints:
  - Python 3.11; FastAPI; SQLAlchemy 2.x async; Alembic; structlog [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table].
  - Postgres in production; tests may use SQLite for unit scope provided features used are supported [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Testing].

### Testing
- Approach: Unit tests at service and API layers [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Test Organization].
- Key Scenarios:
  - First delivery with new `MessageSid` inserts one row; returns 200; logs `duplicate=false`.
  - Duplicate delivery with same `MessageSid` does not insert; returns 200; logs `duplicate=true`.
  - Concurrent duplicate attempt handled by DB unique constraint; one succeeds, the other resolves to duplicate no-op.
- Success Criteria: After two posts with the same `MessageSid`, DB has exactly one message row; responses are 200; log entries differentiate duplicate vs success.
- Special Notes: Avoid network calls; use transactions in repository methods; if using SQLite for unit tests, ensure uniqueness is enforced; integration with Postgres can be added in future integration tests.

**QA Results**
Gate Decision: PASS

Summary:
- All acceptance criteria met. Duplicate posts by identical `MessageSid` result in a single DB row; race-safety is enforced via a unique constraint with proper handling of `IntegrityError` in the repository. Logs clearly differentiate duplicate vs first-process via `duplicate` flag. Fast 200 responses on both paths are verified by tests.

Evidence Reviewed:
- Tests pass: service-level idempotency and API duplicate posting (`tests/unit/services/test_inbound_idempotency.py`, `tests/unit/api/test_twilio_webhook_idempotency.py`).
- Model defines `twilio_sid` as UNIQUE with index; repository catches unique violations and rolls back; service logs `inbound_sms_processed` with `duplicate` boolean.

Top Issues / Recommendations:
- MIG-001 (medium): No Alembic migration included for `sms_messages`. Add an initial migration to align deploy environments with the defined model.
- OBS-002 (low): Duplicate and success share the same log event name (`inbound_sms_processed`). The `duplicate` field is sufficient, but consider distinct event names or structured reason codes if log querying prefers event separation.
- PERF-001 (low): Service performs a pre-read before insert. Consider relying solely on insert-with-unique-guard to reduce one round-trip under high load.
- API-002 (low): Missing `MessageSid` returns 200 (no-op). This is acceptable to avoid retries from Twilio, but document this explicitly in operational runbooks.

Risk Summary:
- Critical: 0, High: 0, Medium: 1 (migration), Low: 3
