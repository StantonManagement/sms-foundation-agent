# Story 3.1: Outbound Send Endpoint

**Status:** Done

**Story**
**As an** integrating service,
**I want** to send an SMS via a simple API,
**so that** I can message tenants and track results.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. POST /sms/send accepts JSON: { to, body, conversation_id? }
2. Validates destination; normalizes number; rejects empty body; returns 400 with errors
3. Creates outbound sms_messages row with direction=outbound and pending delivery_status
4. Sends via Twilio SDK with account SID/auth token and from=TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER
5. Returns 202 with message identifier (twilio_sid if available or internal id), conversation reference
6. Structured logs include request ID, conversation, and destination
7. Tests cover happy path, validation errors, and provider error handling

**Dev Notes**
- Previous Story Insights: Inbound flows exist with idempotent processing by `twilio_sid`, canonical phone upsert for conversations, and structured logging. These establish conventions to reuse for outbound. (No specific guidance found in architecture docs)

- Data Models:
  - `sms_messages`: add `delivery_status` (e.g., queued|sending|sent|delivered|undelivered|failed|receiving|received|unknown) and allow `twilio_sid` to be set after send. Outbound rows start as `pending` then update to `queued`/`sent` on provider response. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#sms_messages]

- API Specifications:
  - Endpoint: `POST /sms/send` with JSON body `{ to: string, body: string, conversation_id?: int }`; returns 202 with `{ id, twilio_sid?, conversation_id }`. [Source: docs/prd/epic-3-details-outbound-send-delivery-tracking.md]
  - Validation: E.164 normalization using phone utils; reject empty/whitespace `body`; 400 with error envelope on invalid input. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical-Rules]

- Component Specifications:
  - `SmsOutboundService`: orchestrates normalization, conversation ensure, message persistence, Twilio send, and status update. [Source: docs/architecture/components.md#SmsService]
  - `TwilioClient`: wraps Twilio REST send and returns MessageSid; maps provider errors to domain errors. [Source: docs/architecture/components.md#TwilioClient]

- File Locations:
  - `src/api/sms.py` — new router and `POST /sms/send`
  - `src/services/sms_outbound.py` — outbound service orchestration
  - `src/adapters/twilio_client.py` — Twilio REST adapter
  - `src/repositories/messages.py` — add outbound insert/update methods
  - `src/utils/config.py` — add Twilio account SID and from number settings
  - Tests: `tests/unit/api/test_sms_send.py`, `tests/unit/services/test_sms_outbound.py`
  [Source: docs/architecture/project-structure.md#Source-Directories]

- Testing Requirements:
  - Use pytest with async tests; isolate Twilio via mock/respx; assert 202 on success, 400 on validation, and appropriate error mapping on provider failures. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Core-Standards]

- Technical Constraints:
  - Python 3.11, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy async, structlog; Twilio SDK per tech stack. Keep endpoint responsive; no blocking retries in request path. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology-Stack-Table]

- Project Structure Notes:
  - Architecture refers to a unified project-structure guide; current repo provides `docs/architecture/project-structure.md` (used above). No `testing-strategy.md` was found; testing guidance references Coding Standards instead. [Source: docs/architecture/project-structure.md]

### Testing
- Approach: Unit-level for router and service; repository behavior validated via unit tests; provider calls mocked.
- Key Scenarios:
  - Valid request sends SMS: returns 202 with `id`, `twilio_sid`, `conversation_id`; logs `outbound_sms_sent`.
  - Validation failures: invalid phone or empty body → 400 with error payload; no DB writes.
  - Provider error: Twilio failure mapped to 5xx or 4xx as appropriate; message remains with `delivery_status=pending|failed` per error handling policy; logs `outbound_sms_failed`.
- Success Criteria: AC 1–7 met with passing tests and structured logs present.

**QA Results**
Gate: PASS

Summary:
- Scope-AC alignment: AC 1–7 are clearly traced to tasks and implemented artifacts; tests listed cover happy/validation/provider error scenarios.
- Test sufficiency: Unit tests described for API and service paths appear adequate; suggest adding repository-level tests for failure status transitions to ensure correctness when Twilio errors occur mid-flight.
- NFRs: Logging and observability covered; performance risk low (single outbound call). Security considerations for secrets present via config; recommend confirming secrets are not logged and that rate limiting or abuse controls are handled at API gateway level.

Findings (Advisory):
- Validation: Story mentions “strict-enough” phone canonicalization (>=10 digits). Consider enforcing E.164 output with country default rules or explicit error when normalization fails to avoid provider rejects.
- Error mapping: Define explicit mapping table in tests for representative Twilio errors (e.g., 21610, 21614) to 4xx vs 5xx to prevent ambiguity.
- Delivery status: Clarify policy for setting `delivery_status` on immediate provider error (pending vs failed). Current note suggests pending|failed; recommend deterministic: set `failed` on synchronous provider errors; reserve `pending` only before provider response.
- Idempotency: If retries occur client-side, specify idempotency key behavior (e.g., dedupe by same body/to within short window or require client-provided key). Not a blocker for this story.

Recommended Tests to Add:
- Repository: Verify `set_sent_result` and a new `set_failed_result` update correct fields and do not regress other columns; ensure transitions are valid state machine moves.
- API: Assert that secrets are never present in logs; can be done by capturing structured logs and inspecting fields.
- Service: Simulate Twilio synchronous failure and assert `delivery_status=failed`, correct log event, and 5xx/4xx mapping as per policy.

Quality Gate Decision: PASS (no blockers). Address advisories in subsequent tasks or during code review.
