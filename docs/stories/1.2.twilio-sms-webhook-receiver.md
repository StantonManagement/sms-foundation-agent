# Story 1.2: Twilio SMS Webhook Receiver with Signature Verification

**Status:** Done

**Story**
**As the** SMS foundation service,
**I want** to receive Twilio inbound SMS webhooks with signature verification,
**so that** only authentic requests are processed and acknowledged promptly.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. POST `/webhook/twilio/sms` accepts standard Twilio form-encoded payloads
2. Verifies `X-Twilio-Signature` using `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`; invalid signatures return 403
3. Valid requests return 200 within Twilio timeout; body may be empty
4. Correlated structured logs include request ID and `MessageSid` when present
5. Automated tests include valid + invalid signature cases

**Tasks / Subtasks**
- [x] Add webhook router (AC: 1–4)
  - [x] Create FastAPI router for `POST /webhook/twilio/sms` that accepts `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` payloads [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#High Level Overview]
  - [x] Place router under API layer per structure, e.g., `src/api/webhooks/twilio.py`; include in app in `src/main.py` [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#Source Directories]
  - [x] Parse fields minimally; do not persist in this story (persistence arrives in later stories) [Source: prd/epic-1-details-foundation-inbound-webhooks.md#Story 1.2]
- [x] Implement Twilio signature verification (AC: 2)
  - [x] Load `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` from configuration (`src/utils/config.py` `Settings`) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Core Standards]
  - [x] Verify `X-Twilio-Signature` using official Twilio helper or equivalent HMAC algorithm against the exact request URL and form params [Source: architecture/components.md#WebhookRouter]
  - [x] On invalid signature, return HTTP 403 without leaking details; log an auth failure event [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#Logging Standards]
- [x] Fast response and logging (AC: 3–4)
  - [x] Respond `200 OK` quickly for valid requests; empty body is acceptable [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Background Work]
  - [x] Structured JSON logs via `structlog` with `request_id` and `MessageSid` when present; never log secrets [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Logging]
- [x] Unit tests for webhook verification (AC: 5)
  - [x] Add tests under `tests/unit/api/test_twilio_webhook.py` for valid and invalid signatures using FastAPI `TestClient` [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Test Organization]
  - [x] Fixture to set `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` and build a canonical signature for a sample request
  - [x] Assert 403 on bad signature; 200 on valid signature; ensure handler tolerates minimal payload

**Dev Notes**
- Previous Story Insights: Service already uses structured logging and an app factory pattern; follow the same logging setup and router include pattern from Story 1.1 [Source: stories/1.1.project-scaffold-and-health-check.md].
- API Specifications:
  - Endpoint: `POST /webhook/twilio/sms` handling `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` per Twilio [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#High Level Overview].
  - Security: Validate `X-Twilio-Signature` using `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`; on failure, return 403 without details [Source: architecture/components.md#WebhookRouter; architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#Logging Standards].
  - Performance: Must return within Twilio timeout; offload non-critical work to background in later stories [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Background Work].
- Logging & Observability:
  - Use `structlog` JSON logs with `request_id` and include `twilio_sid`/`MessageSid` when present. Do not log secrets or full PII payloads [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Logging].
- Data Models:
  - No persistence in this story; idempotency and storage occur in Stories 1.3 and 1.4. Prepare to extract `MessageSid` for logging [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Idempotency; architecture/data-models.md#Inbound Messages].
- File Locations (align with structure):
  - `src/api/webhooks/twilio.py` — webhook router
  - `src/main.py` — include router
  - `src/utils/config.py` — expose `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` in `Settings`
  - `tests/unit/api/test_twilio_webhook.py` — unit tests
  [Source: architecture/project-structure.md#Source Directories]
- Technical Constraints:
  - Python 3.11; FastAPI; structlog; official Twilio SDK available for signature verification [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table].
  - Background tasks will be used in later stories; keep handler minimal here [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Background Work].

### Testing
- Test file location: `tests/unit` for unit tests; prefer FastAPI `TestClient` for handler tests [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Test Organization].
- Frameworks: `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio` (if needed) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Testing].
- Standards: No network calls; compute signatures locally; assert status codes and do not rely on logs for correctness [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Core Standards].
- Specific requirements for this story: assert 403 for bad signature; 200 for valid signature; handler accepts form-encoded payload and includes `MessageSid` in log context when present (log presence can be a non-strict assertion if log capture is configured later).

**QA Results**
Gate Decision: PASS
Reason: All acceptance criteria (1–5) are satisfied with a minimal, correct implementation. Signature verification uses the Twilio HMAC-SHA1 algorithm against the exact request URL and posted form fields; invalid signatures return 403, valid requests ACK with 200 quickly; structured logs include a request_id and MessageSid when present. Unit tests cover valid, invalid, and minimal payload cases and pass locally.

Requirements Traceability
- AC1 (POST /webhook/twilio/sms accepts form-encoded): Implemented via FastAPI router in `src/api/webhooks/twilio.py` using `await request.form()`. Covered by tests posting form data.
- AC2 (Verify X-Twilio-Signature with TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN; 403 on invalid): Implemented in `_compute_twilio_signature` + constant-time compare; rejects invalid with 403. Covered by `test_twilio_webhook_rejects_invalid_signature`.
- AC3 (Return 200 quickly for valid; body may be empty): Returns empty 200 `Response`. Covered by `test_twilio_webhook_accepts_valid_signature`.
- AC4 (Structured logs with request_id and MessageSid when present): Logs `twilio_webhook_received` with `request_id` and optional `twilio_sid` derived from `MessageSid`.
- AC5 (Automated tests include valid + invalid signature cases): Implemented in `tests/unit/api/test_twilio_webhook.py` (valid, invalid, minimal payload).

Test Assessment
- Scope: Unit tests cover signature verification happy/negative paths and minimal payload acceptance. FastAPI `TestClient` used appropriately; dependency override cleanly injects `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`.
- Results: All tests pass locally. Optional: add a case for missing `X-Twilio-Signature` (should 403) and a case with URL query params to ensure canonicalization remains correct.

NFR Assessment (advisory)
- Performance: PASS — trivial parsing and HMAC; constant time relative to small payloads.
- Reliability: PASS — deterministic outcomes; no external dependencies.
- Observability: PASS — structured logs with correlation id and optional SID; secrets not logged.
- Security: PASS (for scope) — HMAC verification and `hmac.compare_digest` used; 403 has no sensitive detail.
- Maintainability: PASS — clear separation (router/config), typed code, small functions.

Risks & Recommendations
- SIG-001 (low): Reverse proxy/host header differences can cause signature mismatches in some deployments. Recommendation: document required proxy headers or reconstruct the URL from `X-Forwarded-*` when present.
- CFG-001 (low): If `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` is unset/empty, all requests will be rejected. Recommendation: fail fast at startup or warn loudly when token is empty in non-local environments.
- OBS-001 (low): Request ID is generated ad hoc in the handler; consider using a middleware-provided request id for end-to-end correlation consistency across the app.

Evidence
- Reviewed: `src/api/webhooks/twilio.py`, `src/utils/config.py`, `src/main.py`, and `tests/unit/api/test_twilio_webhook.py`.
