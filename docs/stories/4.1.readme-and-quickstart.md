# Story 4.1: README and Quickstart

**Status:** Ready for Review

**Story**
**As a** developer,
**I want** a concise README and quickstart,
**so that** I can set up, run, and deploy the service quickly.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. README includes prerequisites, environment variables summary, local run instructions, and deploy notes
2. Dockerfile present; optional docker-compose for local DB/Twilio mocking
3. Quickstart verifies `GET /health` locally with example curl

**Tasks / Subtasks**
- [x] Curate prerequisites and environment variables (AC: 1)
  - [x] Document prerequisites: Python 3.11, virtualenv, Docker, make (optional) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
  - [x] Summarize required env vars: `DATABASE_URL`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`, `MONITOR_API_URL`, `TENANT_PROFILE_API_URL`, `APP_ENV`, `APP_VERSION` [Source: src/utils/config.py]
- [x] Local run instructions (AC: 1,3)
  - [x] Provide commands to install deps and run FastAPI via `uvicorn` using `.env` [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
  - [x] Include example `curl http://localhost:8000/health` with expected 200 response [Source: existing health route tests]
- [x] Container & compose (AC: 2)
  - [x] Ensure `Dockerfile` is referenced; show build and run commands
  - [x] Provide optional `docker-compose.yml` usage notes for local DB (SQLite by default; note Postgres later) and Twilio mocking guidance [Source: docs/architecture/project-structure.md]
- [x] Deploy notes (AC: 1)
  - [x] Add high-level deploy notes (e.g., Cloud Run) with env binding, based on architecture [Source: docs/architecture.md#Infrastructure and Deployment]
- [x] Quickstart section (AC: 3)
  - [x] Step-by-step bullets: clone → create `.env` → run `uvicorn` → verify `/health` → send sample POST to `/webhook/twilio/sms` (optional) [Source: docs/architecture/components.md#WebhookRouter]
- [x] Polish README structure (AC: 1)
  - [x] Add sections: Overview, Prerequisites, Setup, Running Locally, Testing, Containers, Deployment, API Endpoints, Troubleshooting

**Dev Notes**
- Documentation targets quick onboarding and aligns with chosen tech stack (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, httpx). Default local DB uses SQLite via `DATABASE_URL` in settings. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md; src/utils/config.py]
- Health route exists and is tested under `tests/unit/api/test_health.py`; use it in quickstart verification. [Source: tests/unit/api/test_health.py]
- Containerization: Multi-stage `Dockerfile` already present; include build/run commands and note port mapping. [Source: Dockerfile]
- Compose: `docker-compose.yml` exists; mention how to run it for convenience. [Source: docker-compose.yml]
- Environment variables are centralized; document them from the `Settings` model to avoid drift. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Config; src/utils/config.py]
- Deployment notes reference Cloud Run per architecture; emphasize binding env vars and min instances. [Source: docs/architecture.md#Deployment Strategy]
- File Locations to touch:
  - `README.md` — update with sections above
  - Optionally `docs/` — add quickstart snippet if needed
  - No code changes required for this story

### Testing
- Approach: Manual verification per quickstart; automated health check already covered by tests.
- Steps:
  - Create `.env` with minimal vars; run `uvicorn src.main:create_app --reload` and hit `/health` expecting 200
  - Build Docker image and run container; `curl` `/health` inside/outside container
  - Optionally run `docker-compose up` and hit `/health`
- Success Criteria: README instructions work as written; `/health` returns 200; developers can run locally and build container successfully.

**Change Log**
| Date       | Version | Description           | Author |
|------------|---------|-----------------------|--------|
| 2025-09-27 | 0.1     | Initial draft created | SM     |
| 2025-09-27 | 0.2     | Implemented README + quickstart; validated tests | dev    |

**Dev Agent Record**
- Agent Model Used:
  - dev
- Debug Log References:
  - README quickstart verification uses `tests/unit/api/test_health.py`
- Completion Notes List:
  - Updated README with full quickstart and deployment notes
  - Verified health test exists and aligns with docs
- File List:
  - README.md

**QA Results**
Gate: PASS

Summary:
- AC coverage: AC 1–3 are met. README includes prerequisites, env var summary, local run instructions, and deployment notes; Dockerfile and optional docker-compose are present and referenced; quickstart demonstrates `GET /health` with example curl and expected 200.
- Consistency: README instructions align with the actual app entry (`src.main:app`) and existing health route/tests. Container commands and compose usage are accurate for local dev.
- Scope risk: Low. Changes are documentation-focused with existing, covered endpoints.

Traceability (AC → Evidence):
- AC1 — README sections: Prerequisites, Environment Variables, Setup, Running Locally, Deployment present in `README.md`.
- AC2 — Containerization: `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` exist; README shows build/run/compose commands.
- AC3 — Quickstart: README includes `curl http://localhost:8000/health` with expected success. Health endpoint implemented in `src/api/health.py` and covered by `tests/unit/api/test_health.py`.

Findings (Advisory):
- Env Vars Completeness: Consider documenting optional retry/backoff settings defined in `src/utils/config.py` (`TWILIO_SEND_MAX_RETRIES`, `TWILIO_SEND_BASE_BACKOFF_MS`, `TWILIO_SEND_BACKOFF_CAP_MS`) for completeness. Not required for this story’s ACs.
- Containers & Env: For container runs beyond local defaults, note using `--env-file .env` or explicit `-e` vars if secrets (Twilio credentials) are needed inside containers.
- Quickstart Clarity: Consider adding the expected JSON shape from `/health` (ok/version/checks) to reduce ambiguity for new users.

Evidence Reviewed:
- Docs: `README.md`.
- Code: `src/api/health.py`, `src/main.py`, `src/utils/config.py`.
- Tests: `tests/unit/api/test_health.py`.

Quality Gate Decision: PASS (no blockers). Address advisories opportunistically.
