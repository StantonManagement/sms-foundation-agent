# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for SMS Foundation Agent, focusing on backend systems and non‑UI concerns. It is the guiding blueprint for AI‑driven development, ensuring consistency with the PRD and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

Starter Template or Existing Project: N/A – Greenfield project. Starting from scratch aligns the implementation tightly to PRD NFRs (idempotency, observability, durability) without legacy constraints. A cookiecutter FastAPI template may be considered later to accelerate scaffolding.
