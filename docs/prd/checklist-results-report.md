# Checklist Results Report

Executive Summary
- Overall PRD Completeness: 86%
- MVP Scope: Just Right (optional features trimmed; core retained)
- Readiness for Architecture: READY FOR ARCHITECT
- Key Concerns: Add explicit SLOs for webhook response time; include a minimal metrics list; ensure README includes example curl payloads for all endpoints

Category Analysis

| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PARTIAL  | Formal API docs deferred; README to cover examples |

Top Issues by Priority
- BLOCKERS: None
- HIGH: Add webhook response-time SLO (e.g., p95 < 500ms excluding background work); add minimal metrics list (throughput, delivery rates, error rates)
- MEDIUM: Ensure README contains example curl requests/responses for each endpoint; add DB index notes
- LOW: Optional sequence diagrams for inbound/outbound/status flows

MVP Scope Assessment
- Potential Cuts: None (already trimmed to core)
- Missing Essentials: Example payloads and concrete SLOs for performance/availability
- Complexity: Manageable with three epics; strong sequencing
- Timeline: Realistic for focused implementation

Technical Readiness
- Constraints clear (FastAPI, Twilio, Supabase, httpx); idempotency strategy defined
- Risks: External dependencies (Twilio, Supabase) and duplicate handling—addressed by idempotency and retries
- Needs: Confirm DB schema migrations and indexes (unique on `sms_messages.twilio_sid`)

Recommendations
- Add SLOs: Twilio webhook handler p95 < 500ms; status callback p95 < 300ms
- Metrics: requests/sec, Twilio status distribution, duplicate-skip counts, language detection distribution, DB latency
- Docs: Ensure README includes example curl payloads for all endpoints and an env var table; include `.sql` for unique index on `sms_messages.twilio_sid`
- Ops: Optional alert thresholds (e.g., failure rate > 2% over 5m) can be added later
